<h2><span style="font-size:16pt;">Cookies and Other Similar Automated Technologies</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size:11pt;">When you interact with our online services, or open emails we send you, we obtain certain information using automated technologies, such as cookies, web server logs, web beacons, and other technologies. A &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; is a text file that websites send to a visitor&rsquo;s computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor&rsquo;s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A &ldquo;web beacon,&rdquo; also known as an internet tag, pixel tag, or clear GIF, is a tiny graphic image that may be used in our websites or emails.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11pt;">We use these automated technologies to collect your device information, internet activity information, and inferences as described above. These technologies help us to:</span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Remember your information so you do not have to re-enter it;</span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Track and understand how you use and interact with our online services and emails;</span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Tailor our online services to your preferences;</span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Measure how useful and effective our services and communications are to you; and</span></p>
    </li>
    <li style="list-style-type:disc;font-size:11pt;">
        <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Otherwise manage and enhance our products and services.</span></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11pt;">We set some of these automated technologies ourselves, but others are set by third parties who deliver services on our behalf. For example, we may use other companies&rsquo; web analytics services (described in the &ldquo;Third-Party Analytics Services&rdquo; section), which use automated technologies to help us evaluate how customers use our websites.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Your browser can alert you when cookies are placed on your device, and how you can stop or disable them via your browser settings. Please note, however, that without cookies all of the features of our online services may not work properly. If you use a mobile device, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by changing the privacy and security settings on your mobile device.

<h2><span style="font-size:16pt;">Third-Party Analytics Services</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size:11pt;">We may use third-party analytics service providers to help us with our online services. The analytics providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and web server logs to help us analyze how you use our online services. We may disclose your site-use information (including IP address) to these analytics providers, and other service providers who use the information to help us figure out how you and others use our online services.</span></p>

At this time, our websites are not designed to respond to DNT signals or similar mechanisms from browsers.</span></p>
